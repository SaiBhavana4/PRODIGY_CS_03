# Password Complexity Checker

This project provides a simple and efficient tool to evaluate the strength of a user's password. The tool checks the password against several key factors and provides feedback and suggestions for improvement, ensuring that users can create stronger, more secure passwords.

Features:

Password Strength Evaluation: Assesses a password based on its length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Real-time Feedback: Provides suggestions for improving the password to meet the necessary security criteria.

Categories of Strength:

->Very Strong: Meets all criteria and is at least 12 characters long.

->Strong: Meets all criteria and is 8â€“11 characters long.

->Medium: Meets 3 out of 4 criteria.

->Weak: Meets fewer than 3 criteria.

How It Works

1)Password Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long for it to be considered strong.

2)Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: A strong password should contain a mix of both uppercase and lowercase characters.

3)Digits: Including numbers in your password increases its strength.

4)Special Characters: Passwords with symbols (such as !@#$%^&*) are harder to guess and crack.

Based on these factors, the tool will rate your password as Very Strong, Strong, Medium, or Weak, and suggest improvements if necessary.

# Dependencies
